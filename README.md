This file compiles into gb using gbdk2020. It's meant to showcase the use of banking variables and functions along with setup for music using openMPT. Unfortunately I set up the song incorrectly so it stops instead of looping but it gets the point across. 
This would make music that plays on a loop if you put in a more competent .mod file. Very simple but it was helpful for me to learn how to use all of this.
And also this is built on top of a jumping tutorial from GamingMonsters (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6vxF63JJaA). I figure it's easier to show banking and music in action with other components so I stole his public files.
I hope this saves someone all the time learning banking cost me!
